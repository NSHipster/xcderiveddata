# xcderiveddata

A command-line utility that prints the path of the derived data directory
for the current Xcode project.

## Requirements

- Xcode

## Command-Line Usage

The `xcderiveddata` executable can be run from the command line
from any directory with an Xcode project:

```terminal
$ find . -name "*.xcodeproj" -maxdepth 1
MyApp.xcodeproj

$ xcderiveddata
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyApp-abcdefghijklmnopqr1234567890
```

Any additional arguments are passed to `xcodebuild`,
which can be used to set the target, scheme, and any other other options
for the specified project or workspace:

```terminal
$ find . -name "*.xc*" -maxdepth 1
MyApp.xcodeproj
MyFramework.xcodeproj
MyWorkspace.xcworkspace

$ xcderiveddata -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace \
                -scheme MyFramework
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MyFramework-abcdefghijklmnopqr1234567890
```

You can pipe the result of `xcderiveddata` into other commands
to automate your build process.
For example,
here's how to locate any `xcresult` bundles generated by your test target:

```terminal
$ xcderiveddata | xargs -I{} find {} -name '*.xcresult'
```
